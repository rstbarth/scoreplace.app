/**
 * scoreplace.app — Cloud Functions (local source)
 *
 * NOTE: This file intentionally contains ONLY the cleanup functions deployed
 * from this workspace. Other production functions (autoDraw, stripeWebhook,
 * sendPushNotification, createCheckoutSession, ext-firestore-send-email-*)
 * live in Firebase production and were deployed from a different source.
 * They are NOT touched by deploys from here — always use
 * `firebase deploy --only functions:NAME` to target specific functions.
 *
 * The WhatsApp queue function (processWhatsAppQueue) is preserved in
 * index.js.with-whatsapp.backup for when the WHATSAPP_TOKEN /
 * WHATSAPP_PHONE_ID secrets are configured and the integration is ready
 * to deploy.
 *
 * Scheduled jobs currently deployed from here:
 *
 * 1) cleanupOldNotifications: daily at 03:00 BRT, deletes read notifications
 *    older than 90 days across all users via a collection-group query.
 *
 * 2) cleanupOldCasualMatches: daily at 03:30 BRT, deletes finished
 *    casualMatches older than 30 days. Per-player stats persist separately
 *    on user profiles so the room doc is disposable.

// ─── Helper: batched delete of a query, page by page ─────────────────────────

// and avoids ballooning the function's runtime on large cleanups.

// every user's subcollection. Uses a collection-group query, so the first
// run may need a Firestore composite index on the `notifications` collection
// group — Firebase logs an auto-generated console link if missing. The
// window is intentionally generous: users who leave the app dormant for a
// few months keep their unread history; only stale read ones go.

// each user's profile (see _buildAndPersistMatchRecord), so the room doc
// itself is disposable after 30 days. Keeps the collection bounded so the
// per-user `playerUids` array-contains query in getCasualMatchHistory stays
// cheap as the app grows.
